# Organising code

## A simple system

A first step to reproduce (as in trace, understand and repeat) a piece
of analysis is to be able to trace what has been done to obtain a
results.

-   `S00-environment.R` load packages and defines global variables
    (colours, ...).
-   `S01-functions.R` stores project specific functions.
-   `S02-loadData.R` manages all the data input.
-   `S03-analyse1.R` a first batch of analyses.
-   `S04-analyse2.R` another batch of analyses.

-   Figures are saves as `F01-firstFig.pdf`, ...
-   Data is saved/exported as `D01-data.csv`, `D01-result.rda`, ...
-   Possibly in their own directories.

Works for simple analyses, but gets messy quickly.

# Literate Programming and Reproducible Research

## Literate Programming

From the web page describing his book *Literate Programming*, Donald E
Knuth writes:

"Literate programming is a methodology that combines a programming
language with a documentation language, thereby making programs more
robust, more portable, more easily maintained, and arguably more fun to
write than programs that are written only in a high-level language. The
main idea is to treat a program as a piece of literature, addressed to
human beings rather than to a computer. The program is also viewed as a
hypertext document, rather like the World Wide Web. (Indeed, I used the
word WEB for this purpose long before CERN grabbed it!) ..."

## Tangling and Weaving:

-   CWEB: system for documenting C, C++, Java:

``` {.example}
CTANGLE
    converts a source file foo.w to a compilable program file foo.c; 
CWEAVE
    converts a source file foo.w to a prettily-printable and
    cross-indexed document file foo.tex. 
```

\bigskip

In \R you would use `Stangle` and `Sweave`.

## What is Reproducible Research (RR)?

-   Gentleman et al (2004) advocate RR:

> Buckheit and Donoho (35) , referring to the work and philosophy of
> Claerbout, state the following principle: "An article about
> computational science in a scientific publication is not the
> scholarship itself, it is merely advertising of the scholarship. The
> actual scholarship is the complete software development environment
> and that complete set of instructions that generated the figures."

[<http://genomebiology.com/2004/5/10/R80>](http://genomebiology.com/2004/5/10/R80)

- Bioconductor packages are good examples of reproducible research.

- This article is also good background reader for open software
    development.

- Bioconductor has had a positive impact on genomic data
  analysis and beyond into other areas.

## Approaches to RR

1.  Makefiles
2.  Sweave
3.  Others

# Make and Makefiles

## Make and Makefiles

-   Make is an automated build system, designed to avoid costly
    recomputation.

-   `make` examines a **Makefile**, which contains a set of rules
    describing dependencies among files.

-   A rule is run (i.e the recipes are executed) if the **target** is
    older than any of its **dependencies** (**prerequisites**).

``` {.example}
target: prerequisites ...
     recipe
     ...
```

-   `make` works backwards from the target to the prerequisites and
    compares creation time of files (`timestamp`).

## Make and Makefile

-   Example:

``` {.example}
res.txt: param1.dat param2.dat
         simulation param1.dat param2.dat > res1.dat
         post-process res1.dat > res.txt
```

-   Commands to be run should be indented with a TAB.

## A complete Makefile

\scriptsize 
\verbatimtabinput{rr_make/Makefile}


## Graphical description of dependencies

![Dependencies in Makefile](./figures/makedep.pdf)


## Makefile conventions

-   PHONY targets: denote actions; ignore filenames with same name.
    PHONY targets are always out of date, and so always run.

``` {.example}
.PHONY: all clean
all: report.pdf

clean:
    rm -f report.pdf report.log report.aux
    rm -f sim1.* sim2*

```

  command      action
  ------------ ---------------------------------------
  make         check first rule
  make all     rebuild everything
  make clean   remove files that can be rebuilt
  touch file   update timestamp, preserving contents

## Makefile: next steps

-  Automatic Variables:

``` {.example}
sim2.dat: params.R simulator.R
  Rscript simulator.R runif > sim2.dat
```

``` {.example}
sim2.dat: simulator.R params.R 
  Rscript $< runif > $@
```

-   parallel processing `make -j2 job`

-   variables

-   implicit rules

<http://www.bendmorris.com/2013/09/using-make-for-reproducible-scientific.html>

## Makefile: example lab work

-   In the lab session, download `rr_make` files (see URL at end).

\note{stored in directory \url{rr_make}}

-   Experiment with remaking report after changing parameters.

-   Add a new plot to the report, using sim3 -- sampling N numbers from
    rgamma with new parameters (stored in params.R). You will need to
    edit simulator.R too.

# Sweave / knitr

## Sweave: literate programming for R

-   Sweave is the system for mixing LaTeX and \R code in the same
    document.

-   Used within \R often to create "vignettes" which can be dynamically
    run.

-   Allows you to write reports where results (tables, graphs) are
automatically generated by your \R code.

-  `knitr` can be regarded as the successor of `Sweave`: easier to use 
and more flexible.

## Sweave: code chunks

-   An example code chunk: by default we are in 'LaTeX mode'.


``` {.example}
We can then test the procedure a few
times, using the default number 
of darts, 1000:

<<>>=
replicate(9, estimate.pi())
@

And now we are back to \LaTeX ...
```

## Sweave: figures

-   Automatically creates filenames, e.g. `estimate-001.pdf`

-  This is one area where knitr is much more flexible than Sweave.

Some text ...

``` {.example}
<<out.width='.6\\linewidth', fig.align='center'>>=
r <- 1; n <- 50; par(las=1)
plot(NA, xlim=c(-r,r), ylim=c(-r,r), asp=1, bty='n',
     xaxt='n', yaxt='n', xlab='', ylab='')
 ...
@ 
```

... and some more text

## Sweave: tables

-   Use the *xtable* package from CRAN.

-   Example from that package:

``` {.example}
<<echo=FALSE>>=
library(xtable)
data(tli)
@ 

<<label=tab1,echo=FALSE,results='asis'>>=
     ## Demonstrate data.frame
     tli.table <- xtable(tli[1:20,])
     digits(tli.table)[c(2,6)] <- 0
     print(tli.table)
@ 
```

example

## Sweave: including inline computation

``` {.example}
In this case the number of darts within
the circle is \Sexpr{d}, and so the estimated
value is $\pi \approx \Sexpr{4*d/n}$.
```

## Sweave: a full example

-   Example application: estimate the value of $\pi$ using the dartboard method.

-   *estimatek.Rnw*  

-   See handout of estimatek.Rnw and estimatek.pdf

-   Compiling the document with make:

``` {.example}
estimatek.pdf: estimatek.Rnw
	R -e "library(knitr); knit2pdf('estimatek.Rnw')"
```

## knitr: issues and next steps

-   If you edit `.Rnw`, all code is re-run.  However, you can
avoid this by using **cache=TRUE** in the knitr options.


- knitr can also transform Rmd (R inside markdown) into HTML.

-   *odfWeave* and *RHTML* packages allow for output to OpenOffice and
    HTML.


- Home page has lots of examples: http://yihui.name/knitr/

- There is a whole book on this topic:
  **Dynamic Documents with R and knitr, Second Edition**


# Other approaches to RR

## Other approaches to RR

- \R packages: truly reproducible research. \R packages allow you to
  include code, data, documentation, vignettes.

- Jupyter notebooks (Python, Julia, R; 40+ languages covered).
  Successor to Ipython.   http://jupyter.org/ 

-   ProjectTemplate:
    [<http://projecttemplate.net/>](http://projecttemplate.net/)
