                Markdown presents a much easier way to write books and technical
                publications than traditional tools such as LaTeX and Word. The
                bookdown package inherits the simplicity of syntax and
                flexibility for data analysis from R Markdown, and extends R
                Markdown for technical writing, so that you can make better use
                of document elements such as figures, tables, equations,
                theorems, citations, and references. Similar to LaTeX, you can
                number and cross-reference these elements with bookdown. Your
                document can even include live examples so readers can interact
                with them while reading the book. The book can be rendered to
                multiple output formats, including LaTeX/PDF, HTML, EPUB, and
                Word, thus making it easy to put your documents online. The
                style and theme of these output formats can be customized. We
                used books and R primarily for examples in this book, but
                bookdown is not only for books or R. Most features introduced in
                this book also apply to other types of publications: journal
                papers, reports, dissertations, course handouts, study notes,
                and even novels. You do not have to use R, either. Other choices
                of computing languages include Python, C, C++, SQL, Bash, Stan,
                JavaScript, and so on, although R is best supported. You can
                also leave out computing, for example, to write a fiction. This
                book itself is an example of publishing with bookdown and R
                Markdown, and its source is fully available on GitHub.",
